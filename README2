Wheeler-DeWitt Solver

Program to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the early Universe using the Initial Value Problem (IVP) approach.

wdw.gc is an open-source program for solving the (2+1)-dimensional Wheeler-DeWitt equation. It employs the Crank-Nicolson method to discretize the time evolution and constructs a linear system, which is then solved at each timestep using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method.

Features:
- Solves Wheeler-DeWitt equations in (2+1) dimensions
- Crank-Nicolson scheme for time evolution
- Conjugate Gradient (CG) solver for sparse linear systems
- Parameterized via INI configuration file (wdw.ini by default)
- Outputs:
  - Mean values of relevant parameters to standard output
  - CG iteration logs to standard error

Usage:
./wdw.gc <ini_file>

<ini_file> is optional. If not specified, the program will attempt to load wdw.ini.

Compilation:
To compile from source, use GNU C++ compiler version 17 or higher. OpenMP support is required for parallelization.

Example:
g++ -std=c++17 -fopenmp -O3 -c -o wdw.gc.o wdw.gc.cpp
